# Is a birth date entered a palindrome?

This is a project created in Neo G camp, LevelZero for markThirteen.

This is an app which lets the user know if their birthdate is a palindrome, if not, it shows the nearest date to the user which is a palindrome.

## Features


- Asks the user to input birth date

  - app shows nearest palindrome date, it could be previous or a next date
  - app uses ternary operator to show 'days' or 'day' in output based
  
- Bonus Features: usage of setTimeout() and gifs to create artificial delay and better user experience

- Bonus Features: app is responsive.

## Learnings


- learned how split, reverse, and join syntax is different from python
- learned ternary operator which is similar to one-line if-else code in python
- this was a core excercise for strengthening logic building and writing functional programming
- could have also achieved a more efficient code by using recursion

## Tech stack Used

HTML, CSS and Javascript.
